# Het_RISC_V_ChipTapeout_VSD
Welcome to my repository documenting the RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program, where I am participating in a comprehensive hands-on journey through the complete lifecycle of chip development—from RTL design to post-silicon validation and tapeout using Synopsys EDA tools and the SCL180 PDK.
