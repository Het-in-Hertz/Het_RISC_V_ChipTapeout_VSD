## 1.Acknowledgments

I sincerely thank the entire VSD team for their unwavering support, expert guidance, and providing such an exceptional learning platform throughout this RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program. Their dedication to fostering hands-on experience and advancing semiconductor education has been invaluable to my growth as an engineer.

I would also like to express my gratitude to all other involved professionals and institutions who made this program possible, including but not limited to IIT Gandhinagar, Prof. Rajat Moona, Mr.Sameer Patel, Efabless, and Mr. Muhammed Kasim. Their contributions and collaboration have greatly enriched this learning journey.

## 2.Abstract
This repository contains comprehensive installation guidelines for open-source VLSI and EDA toolchains, tailored for academic and project-based workflows. The documented process includes step-by-step instructions to install key tools such as Yosys, Iverilog, GTKWave on Ubuntu 20.04 with a recommended hardware setup (6GB RAM, 50GB storage, 4 vCPUs), ensuring consistency and reliability for new users. Detailed system checks, version requirements, and configuration scripts are supplied to streamline both individual and group development environments in semiconductor and hardware design projects. Usage of oracle virtual machine is advocated in case of Windows and the steps for same are also demonstrated.

This repo is designed for educational purposes and is being submitted as part of a tool setup and system verification exercise, with all tool snapshots and configuration documentation included for transparency and reproducibility.

This also includes a summary of the lecture:Getting started with Digital VLSI SOC Design and Planning.
